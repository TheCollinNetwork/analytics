# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! A few simple guidelines to help keep the repo healthy:

- Branching: create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
- Open a Pull Request back to `main` and include a short description of the change.
- Rebase or merge `main` before requesting a review to keep history clean.
- Keep commits focused and use clear commit messages.

Code style and linters:

- This repo uses `eslint`. Run `npm run lint` to check for lint issues.
- We recommend installing the editor extensions listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`.

If you'd like me to set up CI or PR templates, request it and I'll add a basic GitHub Actions workflow.
